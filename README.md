# Bambora's Ruby SDK (Legacy)

Integration with Bamboraâ€™s payments gateway is a simple, flexible solution.

You can choose between a straightforward payment requiring very few parameters; or, you can customize a feature-rich integration.

To assist as a centralized record of all your sales, we also accept cash and cheque transactions.

For very detailed information on the Payments API, look at the Bambora [developer portal](https://dev.na.bambora.com/docs/references/payment_SDKs/take_payments/).
